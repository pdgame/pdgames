## 🔧 Contact Form Integration

The contact form needs backend integration to actually send emails. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Email Service (Easiest - No Backend)
Use services like:
- **FormSpree** (https://formspree.io) - Free tier available
- **Formcarry** (https://formcarry.com) - Free tier available
- **EmailJS** (https://www.emailjs.com) - Send emails via JavaScript

### Option 2: Static Form Handlers
If hosted on platforms like:
- **Netlify Forms** - Built-in, just add `netlify` attribute
- **Vercel** - Use serverless functions
- **GitHub Pages** - Use FormSpree or EmailJS

### Option 3: Custom Backend
Create your own API endpoint to handle form submissions:
```javascript
// Example in contact.html (already structured for this)
fetch('YOUR-API-ENDPOINT', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(formData)
})
```

### Quick Setup with FormSpree:
1. Sign up at https://formspree.io
2. Create a new form
3. Get your form endpoint URL
4. Update line ~152 in `contact.html`:
   ```html
   <form id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```
